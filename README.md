<H1>PROMOBOT 1.0 (for Windows XP and 7)</H1>

The "PROMOBOT" application has been created to insert promotion through videos, images and texts, which are copied to memories, mobile phones and external disks that are connected to the computer. It is ideal for "package" copy businesses in order to automate some copies.

Some models of use of the application are:

- To promote your own package copying business and its services.
- To promote other businesses such as cafeterias, paladares, shops, etc.
- To publish lists of sales of products and services (classified).
- To promote artistic and cultural events, as well as send congratulations for Mother's Day and other holidays.
- To distribute applications and their updates.

After installing the "PROMOBOT" application, you must select the folder that contains all the files that you want to copy to the clients. Once this is done, every time a storage device is connected to the computer, all the files will be automatically copied inside it.
The program runs automatically with Windows startup and can work in stealth mode while continuing to make copies of promotions. To open the program window again, press the key combination "Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2".

<b><i>We hope that the "PROMOBOT" application will be useful to you in your business models.</i></b>
